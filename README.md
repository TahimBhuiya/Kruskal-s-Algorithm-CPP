# Kruskal’s Algorithm in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates **Kruskal’s Algorithm**, a greedy graph algorithm used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, weighted, undirected graph.

Kruskal’s algorithm builds the MST by sorting all edges by weight and adding them one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed using the **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)** data structure.
